INSTALLING QUERYPATH
==============================

There are two distributions of QueryPath: 

1. The full version, which includes source, documentation, unit tests, 
and examples.

2. The minimal version, which includes only the source code in 
compacted form.

INSTALLING THE MINIMAL VERSION
==============================
To install QueryPath-minimal:
- Extract the contents of the archive:
  
  tar -zxvf QueryPath-2.0-minimal.tgz

- Move the extracted directory to the desired location. Generally,
  it is best to rename this folder 'QueryPath'. 

  mv QueryPath-2.0-minimal myproject/QueryPath
  
  (Alternately, you may wish to install QueryPath in a location available on
  you PHP library path for use in all applications on your system.)
  
- Include QueryPath in your scripts:

  require 'QueryPath/QueryPath.php';
  
- The minimal package does not contain any documentation. To view
  the documentation online, go to http://api.querypath.org.

INSTALLING THE FULL VERSION
==============================
To install QueryPath:

- Extract the contents of the archive.

  tar -zxvf QueryPath-2.0.tgz

- Copy the src/QueryPath directory to the desired location.

  cp QueryPath-2.0/src/QueryPath myproject
  
- Include QueryPath/QueryPath.php in your PHP scripts

  require 'QueryPath/QueryPath.php';
  
The structure of the full version:

/ -- Base information about the library
  src/ -- The source (PHP) code. Include the contents of this directory in your 
    applications.
  test/ -- Unit tests for QueryPath. You can run these with PHPUnit.
  examples/ -- Examples scripts written with QueryPath.
  docs/ -- Full API documentation in HTML format. You can regenerate this from
    the source using PHPDocumentor.
  tutorials/ -- DocBook additions to the QueryPath PHPDocumentor data. An HTML 
    version of this is included in the docs/ directory. The files here are 
    probably only useful when re-generating the API documentation.


INSTALLING FROM GitHub
==============================

The complete source code and all utilities for QueryPath are located in a GitHub
repository. If you plan on contributing back to QueryPath, you will be able to 
achieve the most by working from the GitHub source. Here's how:

1. Obtain the source code from here: http://github.com/technosophos/querypath

2. Install PHPDocumentor, PHPUnit, and Phing. XDebug is strongly recommended for
  doing coverage analysis. These tools are used to auto-generate
  documentation, run unit tests, and manage project builds.
  
3. Run 'phing info' from the base QueryPath checkout. This will tell you how to 
  perform various tasks with QueryPath.
