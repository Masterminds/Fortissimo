The main command for starting a new project is ff.php.

This command is executed like this:

    ff.php projectName

It does the following:

- It creates a new project, named projectName, in the current directory.
- It adds the base directories necessary for that new project.
- It creates customized build.xml and command.xml documents.
  * build.xml is used by Phing. It's like a make or rake file.
  * command.xml is used by the front controller.
- It installs base classes in the App's library.
- Create default .htaccess file
- Create default index file.
