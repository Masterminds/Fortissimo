Fortissimo

The main command for starting a new project is ff.php.

This command is executed like this:

    ff.php projectName

It does the following:

- It creates a new project, named projectName, in the current directory.
- It adds the base directories necessary for that new project.
- It creates customized build.xml and command.xml documents.
  * build.xml is used by Phing. It's like a make or rake file.
  * command.xml is used by the front controller.
- It installs base classes in the App's library.
- Create default .htaccess file
- Create default index file.

## Adding a New Command ##

To add a new command, simply add a new file in the includes directory. The file
should be named MyClass.cmd.php, where MyClass is the name of the command class.

The most common way to create a new command is to extend the BaseFortssimoCommand 
class.

Example:

  class FortissimoEcho extends BaseFortissimoCommand {
  
    public function expects() {
      return $this
        ->description('Echo the contents of the "text" parameter to standard output.')
        ->usesParam('text', 'The text to echo.')
        ->withFilter('string');
    }
  
    public function doCommand() {
      print $this->param('text');
    }
  }
  
The code above implements two methods:

* expects(): Tells the Fortissimo system what parameters this command expects, and
  what it does with those parameters.
* doCommand(): Performs the actual processing of the command.

That's all there is to creating a new command. From there, just add the command
to some request in the `commands.xml` file, and you should be ready.
