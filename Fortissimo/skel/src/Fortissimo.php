 * The Fortissimo core.
 *
 * Fortissimo.php contains the core classes necessary to bootstrap and run an
 * application that makes use of the Fortissimo framework. All of the necessary
 * classes are encapsulated in this single file so that bootstrapping time can be
 * kept to a minimum, with as little loading/autoloading overhead as possible.
 *
 * When this file is loaded, the include path is augmented to include the 
 * includes/, core/, and phar/ directories.
 *
 * <b>Using Fortissimo</b>
 * Fortissimo is a framework for developing web applications. Unlike most
 * web frameworks, it is not based on the MVC pattern. Instead, it uses
 * the front controller pattern, coupled with a variation on the chain-of-command
 * pattern.
 *
 * To get started, look at the command.xml file. The front controller reads 
 * this file to map requests to a sequence of commands. When building a 
 * Fortissimo application, you will be building such mappings yourself.
 *
 * Each request will kick off a chain of zero or more commands, which are 
 * executed in sequence. A command is simply a class that implements the 
 * FortissimoCommand class. Most commands will extend the abstract
 * BaseFortissimoCommand class, which provides a baseline of 
 * functionality.
 *
 * A command can take zero or more parameters. Parameters can be retrieved from
 * a wide variety of sources, the most common being GET and POST data, and 
 * output from other commands. Since commands are highly configurable, they 
 * are input-neutral: the parameters can come from any input. Fortissimo
 * itself handles the retrieval of parameters, and the source of each parameter
 * is configured not in code, but in the commands.xml file. Practically speaking,
 * what this means is that one command can recieve input from a user-configurable
 * source. The data can come from GET, POST, cookies, sessions, other commands, 
 * command line args, or environment variables.
 *
 * To get started with Fortissimo, take a look at some of the unit testing
 * classes or read the online documentation. Then write a custom class implementing
 * the BaseFortissimoCommand.
 *
 * <b>The Fortissimo Autoloader</b>
 * Fortissimo uses the default SPL autoloader to find and load classes. For that
 * reason, if you follow the convention of storing classes inside of files
 * named with the class name, you will not need to use {@link include()} or any
 * other such functions.
 *
 * Current benchmarks indicate that the SPL autoloader is slightly faster than
 * using require/require_once, both with and without an opcode cache.
 *
 * You can augment the autoloader's default paths using <code>include</code>
 * elements in the command.xml file (or manually loading them in via the 
 * config object).
 *
 * The code in the Fortissimo project is released under an MIT-style license.

/**
 * A broad autoloader that should load data from expected places.
 *
 * This autoloader is designed to load classes within the includes, core, and phar
 * directories inside of Fortissimo. Its include path can be augmented using the 
 * {@link addIncludePaths()} member function. Internally, {@link Fortissimo} does this
 * as it is parsing the commands.xml file (See {@link Fortissimo::addIncludePaths}).
 *
 * This loader does the following:
 *  - Uses the class name for the base file name.
 *  - Checks in includes/, core/, and phar/ for the named file
 *  - Tests using three different extensions: .php. .cmd.php, and .inc
 * 
 * So to load class Foo_Bar, it will check the following (in order):
 *  - includes/Foo_Bar.php
 *  - includes/Foo_Bar.cmd.php
 *  - includes/Foo_Bar.inc
 *  - core/Foo_Bar.php
 *  - core/Foo_Bar.cmd.php
 *  - core/Foo_Bar.inc
 *  - core/Fortissimo/Foo_Bar.php
 *  - core/Fortissimo/Foo_Bar.cmd.php
 *  - core/Fortissimo/Foo_Bar.inc
 *  - phar/Foo_Bar.php
 *  - phar/Foo_Bar.cmd.php
 *  - phar/Foo_Bar.inc
 *
 * Then it will search any other included paths using the same 
 * algorithm as exhibited above. (We search includes/ first because 
 * that is where implementors are supposed to put their classes! That means
 * that with a little trickery, you can override Fortissimo base commands simply
 * by putting your own copy in includes/)
 *
 * <b>Note that phar is experimental, and may be removed in future releases.</b>

  /**
   * Information about what parameters the command expects.
   *
   * A command is intended to perform a single discrete task. To perform
   * this task, a command may require one or more input parameters. This 
   * method is used to accomplish two things:
   *
   * - Declare what parameters it uses
   * - Explain what it does
   *
   * The first of these tasks is straightforward: A command uses parameters
   * for input. This method gives the command developer the tools to declare
   * which paramaters are used. Additionally, generic sanitization and validation
   * can automatically be done by the base command. Developers can declare which 
   * filters should be run on data so that the parameters prepared before the 
   * command is executed.
   *
   * The second task is to explain what this command does with these parameters.
   * This is done to provide real-time documentation to developers. A command
   * has the ability to report (using {@link explain()}) what it does, which 
   * expedites the development of a Fortissimo application.
   *
   * An implementation of this function should look something like this:
   *
   * @code
   * <?php
   * public function expects() {
   *  return $this
   *   ->description('This command sends a name to an email address.')
   *   ->usesParam('name', 'The name to echo back')
   *    ->withFilter('string')
   *   ->usesParam('email', 'An email address to echo data to.')
   *    ->withFilter('email')
   *    ->withFilter('validate_email')
   *   ->andReturns('A copy of the sent message.');
   * }
   * ?>
   * @endcode
   *
   * For good examples of expects(), see the following classes:
   *
   *  - FortissimoEcho: Basic example
   *  - FortissimoRedirect: Example using filters and regular expressions
   *  - FortissimoTemplate: Sophisticated example with lots of parameters
   *
   * The above describes a command that expects two parameters: name and email.
   * The name command is validated with the string sanitizer, which makes sure
   * that the string doesn't have markup in it.
   * The email command is first sanitized against the email sanitizer, then it
   * is checked against the email validator to make sure that it is a legitimate
   * email address.
   *
   * @return BaseFortissimoCommandParameterCollection
   *  Returns a collection of parameters. This can be easily obtained by 
   *  calling {@link description()} on the present object. View the example above
   *  or the {@link SimpleCommandTest} class to see basic examples of how to
   *  return the appropriate data from this method.
   *
   * @see SimpleCommandTest::expects() An example can be found in the unit tests.

 * Tracks context information over the lifecycle of a request's execution.

 * a request's execution. State information is inserted into the context by

 * this operation is not without its risks. Finally, objects may use information
 * found in the context, either to perform some operation (writing data to 
 * the client) or to modify the context data.

 * - Shared access to data being generated.
 * - Common access to the logging system (see FortissimoLoggerManager).
 * - Common access to the datasources (See FortissimoDatasourceManager).
 * - Access to the underlying cache engine (so commands can cache their own data). 
 *   See FortissimoCacheManager.
 * - Access to the request mapper. See FortissimoRequestMapper.
 *
 * Thus, every command can utilize the loggers and datasources defined for the
 * application, and commands can pass data throughout the lifecycle of the request.
 *
 * Note that when one request forwards to another request, the context may be 
 * transferred along with it. Thus, sometimes a context will span multiple 
 * defined requests (though this will always be in the handling of one 
 * client serving operation -- i.e., it will only span one HTTP request, even if

/** @defgroup Fortissimo Fortissimo

/** @page Fortissimo
  * Fortissimo is a PHP application-building framework designed for performance, ease of
  * development, and flexibility.
  *
  * Instead of using the MVC pattern, Fortissimo uses a pattern much more suited to web
  * development: Chain of Command.
  *
  * In a "chain of command" (CoC) pattern, we map a <em>request</em> to a series of 
  * <em>commands</em>. Each command is executed in sequence, and each command can build off of the 
  * results of the previous commands.
  *
  * If you are new to Fortissimo, you should get to know the following:
  *
  * - commands.php: The configuration file.
  * - BaseFortissimoCommand: The base command that most of your classes will extend.
  * 
  * Take a look at the built-in Fortissimo commands in src/core/Fortissimo. In particular, 
  * the FortissimoPHPInfo command is a good starting point, as it shows how to build a command
  * with parameters, and it simply outputs phpinfo().
  *
  * Learn more:
  * - Read QUICKSTART.mdown to get started right away
  * - Read the README.mdown in the documentation
  * - Take a look at Fortissimo's unit tests
  *
  * @section getting_started Getting Started
  * 
  * To start a new project, see the documentation in the README file. It explains how to run
  * the command-line project generator, which will stub out your entire application for you.
  *
  * Once you have a base application, you should edit commands.php. While you can configure 
  * several things there (loggers, caches, include paths, etc.), the main purpose of this file
  * is to provide a location to map a request to a chain of commands.
  *
  * For the most part, developing a Fortissimo application should consist of only a few main tasks:
  * define your requests in commands.php, and create commands by writing new classes that 
  * extend BaseFortissimoCommand.
  *
  * Your commands should go in src/includes/. As long as the classname and file name are the same, 
  * Fortissimo's autoloader will automatically find your commands and load them when necessary.
  *
  * @section default_facilities_explained Default Facilities
  *
  * Fortissimo provides several facilities that you can make use of:
  *
  * - Datasources: Fortissimo provides a facility for declaring and working with various data
  *  storage systems such as relational SQL databases and NoSQL databases like MongoDB or even
  *  Memcached. Fortissimo comes with support for Mongo DB (FortissimoMongoDatasource) and
  *  PDO-based SQL drivers (FortissimoPDODatasource). Writing custom datasources is usally trivial.
  * - Loggers: Fortissimo has a pluggable logging system with built-in loggers for printing 
  *  straight to output (FortissimoOutputInjectionLogger), an array for later retrieval
  *  (FortissimoArrayInjectionLogger), or to a system logger (FortissimoSyslogLogger).
  * - Caches: Fortissimo supports a very robust notion of caches: Requests can be cached, and 
  *  any command can declare itself cacheable. Thus, individual commands can cache data. In 
  *  addition, the caching layer is exposed to commands, which can cache arbitrary data. Extending
  *  the caching system is trivial. A PECL/Memcache implementation is provided in 
  *  FortissimoMemcacheCache.
  * - Request Mapper: With the popularity of search-engine-friendly (SEF) URLs, Fortissimo provides
  *  a generic method by which application developers can write their own URL mappers. The 
  *  default FortissimoRequestMapper provides basic support for mapping a URL to a request. You
  *  can extend this to perform more advanced URL handling, including looking up path aliases
  *  in a datasource.
