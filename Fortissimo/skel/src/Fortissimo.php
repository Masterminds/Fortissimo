/**
 * The Fortissimo core.
 *
 * This file contains the core classes necessary to bootstrap and run an
 * application that makes use of the Fortissimo framework. All of the necessary
 * classes are encapsulated in this single file so that bootstrapping time can be
 * kept to a minimum, with as little loading/autoloading overhead as possible.
 *
 * When this file is loaded, the include path is augmented to include the 
 * includes/, core/, and phar/ directories.
 *
 * <b>Using Fortissimo</b>
 * Fortissimo is a framework for developing web applications. Unlike most
 * web frameworks, it is not based on the MVC pattern. Instead, it uses
 * the front controller pattern, coupled with a variation on the chain-of-command
 * pattern.
 *
 * To get started, look at the command.xml file. The front controller reads 
 * this file to map requests to a sequence of commands. When building a 
 * Fortissimo application, you will be building such mappings yourself.
 *
 * Each request will kick off a chain of zero or more commands, which are 
 * executed in sequence. A command is simply a class that implements the 
 * {@link FortissimoCommand} class. Most commands will extend the abstract
 * {@link BaseFortissimoCommand} class, which provides a baseline of 
 * functionality.
 *
 * A command can take zero or more parameters. Parameters can be retrieved from
 * a wide variety of sources, the most common being GET and POST data, and 
 * output from other commands. Since commands are highly configurable, they 
 * are input-neutral: the parameters can come from any input. Fortissimo
 * itself handles the retrieval of parameters, and the source of each parameter
 * is configured not in code, but in the commands.xml file. Practically speaking,
 * what this means is that one command can recieve input from a user-configurable
 * source. The data can come from GET, POST, cookies, sessions, other commands, 
 * command line args, or environment variables.
 *
 * To get started with Fortissimo, take a look at some of the unit testing
 * classes or read the online documentation. Then write a custom class implementing
 * the BaseFortissimoCommand.
 *
 * <b>The Fortissimo Autoloader</b>
 * Fortissimo uses the default SPL autoloader to find and load classes. For that
 * reason, if you follow the convention of storing classes inside of files
 * named with the class name, you will not need to use {@link include()} or any
 * other such functions.
 *
 * Current benchmarks indicate that the SPL autoloader is slightly faster than
 * using require/require_once, both with and without an opcode cache.
 *
 * You can augment the autoloader's default paths using <code>include</code>
 * elements in the command.xml file (or manually loading them in via the 
 * config object).
 *

   * Information about what parameters the command expects.
   *
   * A command is intended to perform a single discrete task. To perform
   * this task, a command may require one or more input parameters. This 
   * method is used to accomplish two things:
   *
   * - Declare what parameters it uses
   * - Explain what it does
   *
   * The first of these tasks is straightforward: A command uses parameters
   * for input. This method gives the command developer the tools to declare
   * which paramaters are used. Additionally, generic sanitization and validation
   * can automatically be done by the base command. Developers can declare which 
   * filters should be run on data so that the parameters prepared before the 
   * command is executed.
   *
   * The second task is to explain what this command does with these parameters.
   * This is done to provide real-time documentation to developers. A command
   * has the ability to report (using {@link explain()}) what it does, which 
   * expedites the development of a Fortissimo application.
   *
   * An implementation of this function should look something like this:
   * <code>
   * <?php
   * public function expects() {
   *  return $this
   *   ->description('This command sends a name to an email address.')
   *   ->param('name', 'The name to echo back')
   *    ->withFilter('string')
   *   ->param('email', 'An email address to echo data to.')
   *    ->withFilter('email')
   *    ->withFilter('validate_email')
   *   ->andReturns('A copy of the sent message.');
   * }
   * ?>
   * </code>
   *
   * The above describes a command that expects two parameters: name and email.
   * The name command is validated with the string sanitizer, which makes sure
   * that the string doesn't have markup in it.
   * The email command is first santized against the email sanitizer, then it
   * is checked against the email validator to make sure that it is a legitimate
   * email address.
   *
   * @return BaseFortissimoCommandParameterCollection
   *  Returns a collection of parameters. This can be easily obtained by 
   *  calling {@link description()} on the present object. View the example above
   *  or the {@link SimpleCommandTest} class to see basic examples of how to
   *  return the appropriate data from this method.
