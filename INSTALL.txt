This is the Fortissimo Framework developers package.

To build this package, you will need the following tools:

- PHPDocumentor (For documentation)
- PHPUnit (For unit testing)
- Phing (For build management)

To create a new project:
========================

1. Run the fff command

$ ./fff.php MyProject

This will create the directory MyProject, initialized and ready for you 
to begin development.

2. Begin working

You can begin adding commands and supporting business logic inside of the 
MyProject/src/includes directory. You can configure your server in 
config/comamnds.xml.

3. Use phing

You can use 'phing -l' to find out what pre-configured tasks are already
available to you. phing provides build management for Fortissimo in much
the same way that rake provides this for Rails and ant provides this for
Java.

To build Fortissimo Framework
=============================

These instructions are for developers who are actively working on 
Fortissimo itself.

1. Use the phing tool to work. To find out the supported Phing 
  commands, run 'phing -l' in this directory.
  
2. If you are using TextMate, you can use the TextMate Fortissimo
  bundle to run various Phing tasks.
